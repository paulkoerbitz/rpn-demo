## RPN.hs - A simple Haskell Introduction

This is a simple introduction to Haskell, demonstrating a few features
while implementing a RPN parser and evaluator.

## Why Haskell?

- Purely functional
  * Very different programming paradigm -> new insights
  * Claim: data & functions are much easier to understand than state
  * Good concurrency story (immutability, STM, ...)

- Types, types, types
  * If it compiles it works
  * "Make illegal states unrepresentable through types"

- Theoratically well grounded
  * Gateway drug to even worse languages such as Coq, Idris, Agda ...
  * Some ideas from mathematics directly applicable

- All the usual claims
  * Terse, expressive, better programmer productivity, yada yada yada
